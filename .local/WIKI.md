# SmartLias Architecture Documentation

## Overview
SmartLias is a modern web-based Barangay Management System built using a **separated frontend-backend architecture**. This document explains our architectural decisions, implementation approach, and the reasoning behind our technical choices.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Why Separated Frontend-Backend Architecture?

Our decision to implement a **decoupled architecture** with separate frontend and backend applications is based on several key principles:

#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Frontend**: Handles user interface, user experience, and client-side logic
- **Backend**: Manages data processing, business logic, and database operations
- **Benefit**: Each team can work independently and focus on their specialized area

#### 2. **Scalability**
- Frontend and backend can be **scaled independently** based on demand
- Different deployment strategies for each layer
- **Future-proof**: Easy to migrate to microservices if needed

#### 3. **Technology Flexibility**
- Frontend can use modern JavaScript frameworks (React/Next.js)
- Backend can use different languages/frameworks (Node.js, Python, Go)
- **Database agnostic**: Can switch databases without affecting frontend

#### 4. **Development Efficiency**
- **Parallel development**: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously
- Clear API contracts define communication between layers
- Easier testing and debugging of isolated components

## Technical Stack

### Frontend (Client-Side)
```
Technology: Next.js with React
Location: /frontend directory
Purpose: User interface and user experience
```

**Why Next.js?**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial page load performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Can generate static pages for better performance
- **Built-in Routing**: File-based routing system
- **React Ecosystem**: Access to vast library of components and tools
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, built-in optimization

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Client-side routing for smooth navigation
- State management for user sessions
- API integration with backend services

### Backend (Server-Side)
```
Technology: Express.js with Node.js
Location: /backend directory
Purpose: API services and business logic
```

**Why Express.js?**
- **Lightweight**: Minimal and flexible web framework
- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Same language as frontend (full-stack JavaScript)
- **Rich Middleware**: Extensive plugin ecosystem
- **RESTful APIs**: Easy to create and maintain API endpoints
- **Rapid Development**: Quick prototyping and development

**Key Features:**
- RESTful API design
- Authentication and authorization
- Data validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging
- Database integration with Supabase

```

## Communication Flow

### API-First Approach
```
Frontend ←→ HTTP/REST API ←→ Backend ←→ Database
```

1. **Frontend** sends HTTP requests to backend API endpoints
2. **Backend** processes requests, applies business logic, and queries database
3. **Database** returns data to backend
4. **Backend** formats response and sends back to frontend
5. **Frontend** updates UI based on received data

### Data Flow Example: User Authentication
```
1. User submits login form (Frontend)
2. Frontend sends POST /api/auth/login (HTTP Request)
3. Backend validates credentials (Controller)
4. Backend queries user database (Model)
5. Backend generates JWT token (Middleware)
6. Backend returns success response (API Response)
7. Frontend stores token and redirects user (State Update)
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. **Local Development Setup**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend server
cd backend
npm run dev  # Runs on localhost:9000

# Terminal 2: Start frontend server
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Runs on localhost:3000
```

### 2. **API Development Cycle**
1. **Design API endpoints** (documentation first)
2. **Implement backend routes** and controllers
3. **Test API endpoints** using tools like Postman
4. **Update frontend services** to consume new APIs
5. **Integrate with frontend components**

### 3. **Testing Strategy**
- **Backend**: Unit tests for controllers and integration tests for APIs
- **Frontend**: Component testing and end-to-end user flow testing
- **API**: Automated testing of all endpoints with various scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Backend Security
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for user sessions
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **CORS**: Control cross-origin requests

### Frontend Security
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage of authentication tokens
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation for better UX
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user inputs
- **HTTPS**: Secure communication in production

## Database Design

### Supabase Integration
```
Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
Authentication: Supabase Auth
Storage: Supabase Storage (for file uploads)
Real-time: Supabase Realtime (for live updates)
```

**Why Supabase?**
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with advanced features
- **Built-in Authentication**: Reduces development time
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates for collaborative features
- **REST API**: Auto-generated APIs for rapid development
- **Dashboard**: User-friendly admin interface

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Frontend**: Local development server (localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: Local Express server (localhost:9000)
- **Database**: Supabase cloud instance

### Production Environment
- **Frontend**: Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
- **Backend**: Cloud hosting (Railway, Heroku, AWS)
- **Database**: Supabase production instance
- **CDN**: Content delivery for static assets

2. **TypeScript**: Add type safety across the entire stack
3. **GraphQL**: More efficient data fetching for complex queries
4. **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
5. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Technology Migration Path
- **Backend**: Can migrate to Python (Django/FastAPI) or Go without affecting frontend
- **Frontend**: Can upgrade to newer React versions or migrate to other frameworks
- **Database**: Can switch to other databases with minimal backend changes
- **Hosting**: Can move to different cloud providers easily
